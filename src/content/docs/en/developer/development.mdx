## Developing with Docker

TutoriaLLM allows you to develop and host the app using Docker. The core parts of TutoriaLLM are provided as Docker images, and you can deploy the app to a server by connecting it to a database using Docker compose. Follow the steps below to deploy the app to a server.

<Aside type="note" title="About Docker">
  For information about Docker, please refer to the official
  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) website.
</Aside>

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the GitHub repository to start development. You can edit the code using your preferred editor and use Docker to run the app in a local environment.

  href="https://github.com/TutoriaLLM/TutoriaLLM"
/>

Additionally, Docker is required to run the app. If Docker is not installed, please install it from the following link.

/>

<Aside type="note" title="If not developing">
  If you are not developing, you can use the image directly from [Docker
  Hub](https://tutoriallm.com/developer/host/). You will need to connect to
  Pgvector (or PostgreSQL with Vector support) and Redis.
</Aside>

### Creating the Compose File

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  This file refers to the `docker-compose.yml` file in the [GitHub
  repository](https://github.com/TutoriaLLM/TutoriaLLM/). This file is for
  developers and omits settings like SSL, but supports features like telemetry.
  If you are [building a production app](/developer/host), it is recommended to
  use the `docker-compose.prod.yml` file for SSL and other settings.
</Aside>

import composeExample from "../../../media/code/docker-compose.yml?raw";

Below is an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file that can be used for development:

<Code code={composeExample} lang="yaml" title="/docker-compose.yml" />

### Setting Environment Variables

Below are examples of environment variables. Adjust them according to your deployment method:

- AUTH_SECRET - Secret used for authentication settings
- OPENAI_API_KEY - Key for using the OpenAI API
- OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT - Endpoint for the OpenAI API. If not set, the default endpoint will be used.

- DB_USER - Database username
- DB_PASSWORD - Database password
- DB_PORT - Database port number (e.g., 5432)
- DB_HOST - Database hostname (e.g., 'db')
- DB_NAME - Database name

- REDIS_HOST - Redis hostname

- DEFAULT_USER_NAME - Default username
- DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD - Default user password

- TELEMETRY_EXPORT_URL - URL for exporting telemetry data. Set this if using something like OpenTelemetry.

### Starting the Server

You can host the server using Docker. Start the development server with the following command:

```sh

docker compose up

# To build

docker compose up --build

# To start in the background

docker compose up -d

```

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  TutoriaLLM uses port 3000 for the app and port 3001 as the entry point for VM
  execution.
</Aside>

### Using HMR

If you want to use HMR (Hot Module Replacement), start with the following command. The files will automatically reload when changed.

<Aside type="note" title="What is HMR?">
  HMR is a feature that automatically reloads files when they are changed. In
  TutoriaLLM, you can use `docker compose watch` to change files without
  restarting Docker.
</Aside>

```sh

docker compose watch

```
