## Using Docker

TutoriaLLM allows you to develop and host the app using Docker. The core parts of TutoriaLLM are provided as Docker images, and you can deploy the app to a server by connecting it to a database using Docker compose. Follow the steps below to deploy the app to a server.

<Aside type="note" title="About Docker">
  For information about Docker, please refer to the official
  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) website.
</Aside>

## Preparing the Deployment Server

Prepare a server or computer with Docker installed.

<Aside type="caution" title="Caution!">
  Caution: If you deploy to a platform that requires SSL, Minecraft-related
  features may not work properly. Minecraft does not support SSL (HTTPS), so to
  resolve this issue, you need to either disable SSL or disable the
  Minecraft-Core extension.
</Aside>

## Obtaining the Image

The image is available on Docker Hub. Various versions are provided, but it is recommended to use the latest version. To use the image, you need to connect to Pgvector (or PostgreSQL with Vector support) and Redis.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  This file refers to the `docker-compose.prod.yml` file in the [GitHub
  repository](https://github.com/TutoriaLLM/TutoriaLLM/). This file sets the
  necessary environment variables to run a secure app using a reverse proxy. It
  also includes settings for automatic updates using Watchtower.
