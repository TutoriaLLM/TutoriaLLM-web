TutoriaLLM is a self-hosted programming learning platform using LLM, available on the web. This platform is designed for those who create educational content and those who learn from that content.

<Aside type="caution" title="Caution">
  TutoriaLLM is software for creating a site that provides tutorials on a
  server, not the name of a standalone application. You can use TutoriaLLM to
  host an application that provides tutorials.

### For Learners

Users utilizing the tutorials can learn the basics of programming through interactive sessions with LLM (AI) via an intuitive interface. All you need is a web browser, and since all sessions are managed on the server side, you can resume from any device at any time.

Additionally, the programs created in the tutorials are executed on the server side and can be integrated with other applications. Currently, [integration with Minecraft](/userguides/minecraft) is possible, allowing you to run programs.
